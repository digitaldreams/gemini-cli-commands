description = "Creates comprehensive UML and system models"
prompt = """
You are a system analyst specializing in UML and system modeling.
Based on @tasks/requirements.md, create comprehensive system models using multiple UML diagrams.


## Your Task

Create a detailed `tasks/system_model.md` file by analyzing:
- `tasks/requirements.md` - Project requirements
- `tasks/architecture.md` - System architecture

## System Modeling Framework:

There are couple of UML diagrams type but make sure you only choose what actually needed to demonstrate the idea. No extra graphs please.
Please do not repeat same scenario on multiple diagram. Only Create 1-3 main flow diagram if needed.
Diagram should be simple. Show only main and hide details.

### 1. Use Case Model

**Actors**:
List all actors (users, external systems):
- Primary Actors: [Those who achieve goals]
- Secondary Actors: [Supporting actors]
- System Actors: [External systems]

**Use Cases**:
For each use case provide:
```
UC-XXX: [Use Caseysssss Name]
Actor: [Primary actor]
Description: [What the use case achieves]
Preconditions: [State before execution]
Main Flow:
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  ...
Alternative Flows:
  - [Alternative scenario]
Postconditions: [State after execution]
Includes: [UC-YYY] (if this UC uses another)
Extends: [UC-ZZZ] (if this UC extends another)
Priority: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
```

**Use Case Diagram Description**:
Describe in text format which actors connect to which use cases and their relationships.

### 2. Class Diagram

**Relationships**:
- **Association**: Class A ← → Class B [describe relationship]
- **Aggregation**: Whole ◇→ Part [has-a relationship, lifecycle independent]
- **Composition**: Whole ◆→ Part [has-a relationship, lifecycle dependent]
- **Inheritance**: Parent ← Child [is-a relationship]
- **Dependency**: Class A - - → Class B [uses relationship]

**Mermaid Syntax**:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ClassName {
        +attributeName: type
        +methodName() returnType
    }
    ParentClass <|-- ChildClass
    ClassA o-- ClassB
```

### 3. Sequence Diagrams

Create Squence diagram if really necessary.
```
Scenario: [Scenario Name]
Actors/Objects: [List of participants]
Sequence:
  1. Actor → Object: message1()
  2. Object → Object2: message2()
  3. Object2 → Object: response()
  4. Object → Actor: result()

Notes:
  - [Important details about interactions]
  - [Timing considerations]
```

**Mermaid Syntax**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor->>Object: message()
    Object->>Object2: call()
    Object2-->>Object: return
    Object-->>Actor: result
```

### 4. State Machine Diagrams

For objects with significant state changes:
```
Object: [Object Name]
States:
  - [State1]: [Description]
  - [State2]: [Description]

Transitions:
  - [State1] → [State2]: [Event/Condition] / [Action]
  - [State2] → [State3]: [Event/Condition] / [Action]

Initial State: [Starting state]
Final States: [Ending states]
```

**Mermaid Syntax**:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> State1
    State1 --> State2: event
    State2 --> [*]
```

### 5. Activity Diagrams

For complex workflows or business processes:
```
Process: [Process Name]
Swimlanes: [Actor/System partitions]

Activities:
  1. [Start]
  2. [Activity 1]
  3. [Decision point]
     - If [condition]: [Activity 2]
     - Else: [Activity 3]
  4. [Parallel activities]
     - [Fork into Activity 4a and 4b]
     - [Join after both complete]
  5. [End]
```

**Mermaid Syntax**:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start --> Activity1
    Activity1 --> Decision{Condition?}
    Decision -->|Yes| Activity2
    Decision -->|No| Activity3
```

### 6. Component Diagram

Show high-level system structure:
```
Components:
  - [Component1]
    - Provides: [Interface1, Interface2]
    - Requires: [Interface3]
  - [Component2]
    - Provides: [Interface3]
    - Requires: [Interface4]

Dependencies:
  - Component1 → Component2 (via Interface3)
```


### 8. Entity-Relationship Diagram

Database design:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY1 ||--o{ ENTITY2 : has
    ENTITY1 {
        int id PK
        string name
    }
```


Provide comprehensive models with explanations and multiple diagram representations (textual and Mermaid).
