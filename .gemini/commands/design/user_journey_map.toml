# Task: Generate User Journey Insights

You are a senior UX researcher who delivers **actionable insights, not documentation theater**. Create a focused journey map that identifies the 3-5 most critical user flows and their biggest problems.

## Your Task

Analyze these files to understand the system:
- `tasks/requirements.md` - User needs and features
- `tasks/architecture.md` - Technical capabilities
- `@tasks/model_classes_erd.md`
- `@tasks/tasks.md`


Create `tasks/user_journeys.md` that is:
- **Concise**: 500-800 lines max
- **Insight-driven**: Focus on problems and opportunities, not process description
- **Actionable**: Every pain point has a solution with impact/effort estimate
- **Readable**: Use natural language, not bullet-template hell

## Output Format

```markdown
# User Journey Insights

**Project:** [Name]
**Generated:** [Date]
**Focus:** Critical user flows and their biggest obstacles

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** [One sentence describing the biggest UX problem]

**Impact:** [What this costs the business - conversions, retention, support tickets]

**Recommended Action:** [The #1 thing to fix first]

---

## Primary Users

### [Persona Name] - [Role]
The person who [primary job to be done]. They need to [main goal] but struggle with [main frustration].

**Context:**
- Uses the system [frequency] on [device]
- Technical comfort: [Low/Medium/High]
- Main goal: [What success looks like for them]
- Biggest frustration: [What makes them want to quit]

### [Persona 2 Name] - [Role]
[Same concise format]

---

## Critical Journey: [Name]

**Who:** [Persona]
**Goal:** [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Why it matters:** [Business impact if this fails]

### The Happy Path

[Write 2-3 paragraphs in natural language describing the ideal flow, like you're telling a story]

Example:
"Sarah discovers the app through a Google search. She lands on a clean homepage that immediately shows her the main benefit. She clicks 'Start Free Trial' and sees a simple form asking only for email and password. Within 30 seconds, she's in the app seeing her personalized dashboard with helpful tooltips guiding her to her first action."

### Where It Breaks 🚨

**Problem 1: [Specific issue]**
- **What happens:** [User's experience]
- **Why it hurts:** [Business metric affected - e.g., "40% abandon here"]
- **Root cause:** [Technical or design reason]
- **Fix:** [Specific solution]
  - Effort: [S/M/L]
  - Impact: [% improvement expected]
  - Quick win: [Yes/No]

**Problem 2: [Specific issue]**
[Same format]

**Problem 3: [Specific issue]**
[Same format]

### Technical Touchpoints

Only if relevant to understanding the problem:

```
User action → Frontend → API → Backend → Result
[Only include when technical constraints cause UX issues]
```

---

## Critical Journey 2: [Name]

[Same format - but only include 2-4 total journeys, focus on what matters most]

---

## Secondary Journeys (Quick Overview)

**[Journey name]:** [One sentence problem statement]
**Fix:** [One sentence solution]

**[Journey name]:** [One sentence problem statement]
**Fix:** [One sentence solution]

| Problem | Impact | Solution | Effort |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| [Specific UX issue] | [$ or % lost] | [What to do] | [Days] |
| [Issue 2] | [Impact] | [Solution] | [Days] |

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

These take < 3 days and have immediate impact:

1. **[Fix name]**
   - Problem: [What's broken]
   - Solution: [How to fix it]
   - Impact: [Expected improvement]

2. **[Fix name]**
   [Same format]

3. **[Fix name]**

## Visual Journey Diagrams (Mermaid.js)

**For each critical journey, create a visual diagram using Mermaid.js User Journey syntax.**

**Documentation:** https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/userJourney.html

### Mermaid.js Syntax
```mermaid
journey
    title Journey Title
    section Section Name
      Task 1: Score: Actor
      Task 2: Score: Actor
      Task 3: Score: Actor
```

### Satisfaction Scores

Use scores 1-5 to indicate user satisfaction at each step:
- `5` = Very Satisfied 😄
- `4` = Satisfied 🙂
- `3` = Neutral 😐
- `2` = Dissatisfied 😕 (Pain point)
- `1` = Very Dissatisfied 😞 (Critical issue)

### Example
```mermaid
journey
    title User Registration Journey
    section Discovery
      Land on homepage: 4: User
      Read value proposition: 3: User
      Click Sign Up: 5: User
    section Registration
      Fill form (too many fields): 2: User
      Submit form: 3: User
      Wait for email: 2: User
    section Activation
      Check email (in spam): 1: User
      Click verify link: 4: User
      First login: 5: User
```

### Usage Guidelines

- Create diagrams for 3-5 critical journeys only
- Scores show user satisfaction at each step
- Low scores (1-2) highlight pain points to fix
- Include diagram before the narrative description of each journey
- Steps with scores < 3 should be listed in "Where It Breaks" section

---

## Metrics That Matter

**Track these to know if we're improving:**

**Acquisition:**
- Sign-up conversion: [Current: X%] → [Target: Y%]

**Activation:**
- Users completing first action: [Current: X%] → [Target: Y%]

**Retention:**
- Day 7 return rate: [Current: X%] → [Target: Y%]

**Performance:**
- Page load time: [Current: Xs] → [Target: Ys]

**Note:** If current numbers unknown, write "Baseline TBD - measure first"

---

## What We're Assuming

These journey maps are based on:
- Requirements analysis (not user interviews)
- Architecture capabilities (not actual usage data)
- Industry best practices

**Validation needed:**
- [ ] User interviews to confirm personas
- [ ] Analytics to measure actual behavior
- [ ] Usability testing on critical flows
- [ ] A/B tests for proposed fixes

**Update this doc after validation with real data.**

---

## Implementation Plan

### Month 1: Quick Wins
- [Fix 1]
- [Fix 2]
- Set up analytics for journey tracking

### Month 2: Critical Fixes
- [Major problem 1 solution]
- User testing on improved flow

### Month 3: Measure & Iterate
- Review metrics
- Address next tier of problems

## Appendix: Research Artifacts

**Persona Interview Guide:** [If needed, link or include brief version]
**Analytics Events to Track:** [List key events]
**Usability Test Script:** [If needed]

```

## Key Improvements

**CRITICAL CHANGES:**

1. **90% shorter** - Focus on insights, not process description
2. **Natural language** - Write like a human, not a template robot
3. **Business impact** - Every problem states what it costs
4. **Honest about assumptions** - Admits when numbers are estimates
5. **Action-focused** - Every section has clear next steps
6. **Skimmable** - Headers and tables make it easy to scan

**WHAT TO REMOVE:**

❌ Technical flow diagrams (unless they explain UX problems)
❌ Exhaustive touchpoint inventories
❌ Repetitive stage descriptions
❌ Fake precision ("< 2.3 minutes")
❌ Obvious opportunities ("make it faster")

**WHAT TO ADD:**

✅ Business context (why this matters)
✅ Honest uncertainty (what we don't know)
✅ Prioritization (what to do first)
✅ Validation plan (how to confirm assumptions)
✅ Emotional narrative (tell the story)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Instead of:
"Confirm creation, number of personas created, number of journeys mapped..."

Use:
"Created journey insights document focusing on [X critical flows]. Identified [Y] high-impact problems with solutions. Top priority: [specific fix]. Next step: [validation method]."

## The Real Problem

The original template treats UX research like a **compliance exercise** - "fill out all the fields and we're done!"

Good UX research is **detective work**:
- What's the biggest problem?
- Why does it happen?
- What's the simplest fix?
- How do we know if it worked?

Your doc should answer those questions, not create a museum of bullet points.

**Make it something people will actually read and act on.**
