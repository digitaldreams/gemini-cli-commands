Epic 3 (Feature B): TASK-301, TASK-302, ...
```

### 4. Effort Estimation
- Small: 1 day
- Medium: 2-3 days
- Large: 4-5 days
- Complex: 1+ week (break down further)

### 5. Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocking other work, must be done first
- **High**: Core functionality, important features
- **Medium**: Nice to have, secondary features
- **Low**: Polish, optimizations, non-urgent

### 6. Dependencies
Always list which tasks must be completed first:
- TASK-XXX must be done before TASK-YYY
- Note if tasks can be done in parallel
