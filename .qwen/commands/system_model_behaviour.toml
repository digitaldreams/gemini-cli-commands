description = "Generates behavioral diagrams (Sequence, State) based on system design and requirements"
prompt = """
You are a system behavior analyst specializing in dynamic interaction models.
Based on `tasks/requirements.md`, the architectural foundation in `tasks/system_design.md`, and the detailed structure from `tasks/model_classes_erd.md`, create behavioral models for key system flows.

## Your Task

Create or update `tasks/model_behavior.md` by analyzing:
- `tasks/requirements.md` - Project requirements (especially user stories/flows)
- `tasks/system_design.md` - High-level architecture
- `tasks/model_classes_erd.md` - Detailed classes/ERD (optional reference)

## Modeling Focus:

### 1. Sequence Diagrams (if necessary)

Create a sequence diagram only if the interaction flow is complex or critical. Focus on one main scenario or a common alternative flow.

**Mermaid Syntax (`sequenceDiagram`):**
- Define participants: `actor User`, `participant ComponentA`, `participant Database`.
- Show interactions: `User->>ComponentA: Request()`, `ComponentA->>Database: Query()`, `Database-->>ComponentA: Response`, `ComponentA-->>User: Result()`.

**Content:**
- Scenario: [Brief description of the scenario modeled].
- Actors/Objects Involved: [List participants].
- Generate the Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` code block showing the interaction flow.
- Notes: [Any important timing or conditional notes].

### 2. State Machine Diagrams (if necessary)

Create a state diagram for an object or system component identified in `system_design.md` or `model_classes_erd.md` that has significant state changes.

**Mermaid Syntax (`stateDiagram-v2`):**
- Define states: `[*] --> State1`, `State1 --> State2 : Event/Condition`, `State2 --> [*]`.
- Use composite states `{ }` if needed: `state ForkState { ... }`.
- Use `--` for concurrency if applicable.

**Content:**
- Target: [Object/Component being modeled].
- Generate the Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` code block showing states and transitions.
- Briefly explain the main states and transitions.

Choose the most appropriate diagram type (or both) based on the complexity of the behavior being modeled. Only create diagrams if they add significant clarity over textual description.
